Boiler plate for p5.play


Algorithms - parts of functions that have a specific task
eg: isTouching()

bounceOff();


functions- specific tasks
 


- horizontal: x position
             velocityX
             right and left edges
             width

- vertical : y position
            velocityY
            top and bottom edges
            height


distance- between the centers of the sprites.

1.the diff between x position
2.  half of sum of their widths
